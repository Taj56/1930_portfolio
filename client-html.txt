                    The Island Destination app, your gateway to discovering hidden gems in Jamaica, whether you're a local or a tourist. Our app is thoughtfully designed to help you uncover the best recreational and leisure spots across the island. <br>
    
                    This past summer, 1930 Media took on the exciting challenge of creating an online marketing plan for the Island Destination app with a clear mission – to boost downloads and users. Our goal was to welcome approximately 1,000 new downloads and engage 3,000 users island-wide. <br>
                    
                    Our strategy encompassed the creation of captivating social media content, shedding light on both new and cherished locations featured in the app. To sweeten the deal, we rolled out discount promotions for all camping trips conducted during the season. The results exceeded expectations, with a remarkable 2,000+ downloads and an impressive 5,000 active users. <br>
                    
                    In addition to this milestone, we're thrilled to share that the app's developer, Travis Rhooms, received well-deserved recognition. His achievements were spotlighted in prestigious publications, including The Gleaner and Yahoo News. <br>
                    
                    We're immensely proud to have played a part in promoting the Island Destination app and look forward to more successful journeys ahead

                    Art of Mine Accessories JA, a small female-owned business, commenced its journey on January 5, 2021. Specializing in crafting unique items from resin, acrylic, and wood, including keychains, clocks, signs, paintings, and decor, Art of Mine partnered with 1930 Media to launch on social media. <br>

                    Our mission was clear: foster a vibrant community around the brand and drive sales. We set up and actively managed social media profiles, posted consistently, and ran targeted ads, amassing 200 followers in the first month. To boost engagement, we initiated an exciting five-day giveaway that encouraged followers to repost their favorite pieces and tag friends. This effort resulted in a 25% growth in followers and engagement. <br>
                    
                    Since then, Art of Mine has flourished, now boasting a dedicated following of 652 supporters. Furthermore, they've successfully launched a website where customers can conveniently purchase ready-made items and place custom orders to suit their preferences. <br>
                    
                    Notably, the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) discovered Art of Mine, leading to the creation of custom clocks and pieces. This collaboration highlights our commitment to nurturing emerging businesses into thriving success stories.

                    In August 2023, 1930 Media crafted a vibrant brand identity for an emerging coconut water brand in Portland. Our comprehensive branding package included the brand name, logo, colors, slogan, labels, and packaging. In just 7 days, we brought 'Reach Jelly' to life. Since then, Reach Jelly has triumphed, selling over 2,000 bottles of their delicious coconut water.
